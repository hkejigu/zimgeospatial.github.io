    <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Data on Zimbabwe is pretty scattered all over the web and efforts by the national data custodians to implement distribution infrastructure/ initiatives are minimal if existent.  One usually finds this data embedded in pdfs, spreadsheets or images. Making any use of the same requires converting to the appropriate format of which time one may not have.Additionally there is lack of contextual exposure of data resulting in stifled innovative use of such. Try finding <i>Murerekwa Primary School</i> for instance on an online map..[now that you're back, from GeoNames, if you tried hard enough), read on!</p>
      
      <h2>Which Zimbabwe?</h2>
      
      <p>In case you're here by accident but would stay,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe"> Zimbabwe</a> is a nation in Africa. The map below should (hopefully) help you get oriented.</p>

      <h2>Project Motivation</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Pool together usable geospatial data on Zimbabwe in a somewhat 'quickly' usable format from whichever source inorder to promote innovative use of data.</li>
     
      </ul>

      <h2>Repository Structure</h2>

      <p>Each repository contains a set of files which are intended to serve varying purposes. The list below gives an insight into each file's contents and what purpose each file serves.</p>

      
      <ul>
        <li><code>README.md</code> :: Contains the metadata about the repository. To be used for checking on data currency and attribution.</li>
        <li><code>filename.shp</code> :: Is a compressed (zipped) version of the data in shapefile format. Due to field_name size restrictions of the shapefile format it is advisable to interpret the field names in the associated README.md file.</li>
        <li><code>filename.geojson</code> :: Is the spatial data. To be used for previewing the data and for manipulation with tools such as <a href="http://geojson.io">GeoJson.io</a> - a quick, simple tool for creating, viewing, and sharing maps. And <a href="http://gitspatial.com">GitSpatial</a> -  a spatial API that fronts and syncs your GeoJSON hosted by GitHub.</li>
        <li><code>filename.topogeojson</code>:: Is the spatial data in topogeojson format. To be used for data previewing purposes for large datasets.</li>
        <li><code>filename.csv</code> ::: Is the spatial data in Comma Separated Values. To be used for searching and having a visual peek at the attribute data.</li>
      </ul>

      
    <h2>Participating</h2>

      <p>You're welcome to consume and edit datasets. We're particularly interested in having up-to-date data and correct attributes, spellings e.t.c. Be sure to feedback via email (zimgeospatial [at] gmail.com] or twitter @zimgeospatial</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>1. If you're geeky, folk, edit, submit pull request.</li>
        <li>2. If you've no idea what 1 was about, just download the zipped shapefile and you are good to go.</li>
        <li>3. Or simply email the data you wish to share or intend to receive.</li>
      </ul>
